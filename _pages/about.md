Faouzi is French. He lived in France, Germany, Portugal and live now in Belgium where he works full-time as a Bioinformatic & Data Engineer at [**Biolizard**](https://lizard.bio/)

He previously worked during 8 years as a scientist in Immunology and got hooked by the Bioinformaticians' black magic! He decided to dive more into the IT and start learning how to program for data 2 years and a half ago. In the process, he got graduated in Data engineering from the [**Data ScienceTech Institute**](https://www.datasciencetech.institute/).

He worked (i) as an intern in [**Altran**](https://capgemini-engineering.com/be/en/) for a mission of 8 weeks focused on the development of a computer vision system for the Portuguese national electricity company; (ii) at [**Adaltas**](https://www.adaltas.com/en/) where he improved his skills in infrastructure with notably the deployment of Hadoop clusters; and (iii) at [dataroots](https://dataroots.io/) where he deployed and maintained data pipelines in Spark for a banking institution.

He likes working in the Python ecosystem. He has a focus on Data Engineering but works his way through Data Analysis and Machine Learning.
