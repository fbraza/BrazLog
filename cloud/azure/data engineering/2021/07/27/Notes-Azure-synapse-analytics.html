    <p>I am going to share my notes taken during the preparation for the Azure Data Engineer certification (DP-203). I will share them through a series of articles that cover the main concepts and features behind the Azure services needed for Data Engineering. The last set of articles will be focused on cloud architectures and pattern with Azure. If you want to access a specific topic have click to the desirable article below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cosmos DB</li>
  <li>Azure SQL</li>
  <li>Azure Synapse Analytics</li>
  <li>Azure Data Factory</li>
  <li>Azure Databricks</li>
  <li>Azure Event Hub and Azure Stream Analytics</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, we are going to talk about the Azure Synapse Analytics service which provides a comprehensive approach for ETL / ELT. It allows you to ingest data, prepare and train it (Synapse SQL and Spark pool) and serve it to a Data warehouse. Several connectors exists to then analyze and visualize the data like power BI. We are going to focus mainly and the SQL solutions proposed by Azure Synapse and see their features.</p>

<h2 id="azure-sql-service">Azure SQL service</h2>

<p>There are three main deployment options and choices that can fit your need if you want to deal with Azure SQL services.</p>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-27-06-Azure-SQL.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="sql-database">SQL database</h3>

<p>This is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) that takes care of the database software upgrades,the patches, the backups and the monitoring. using this service you can provide a highly available storage layer for your applications. You have two deployment options: (i) the <strong>single database</strong> which is a managed and isolated database and the (ii) the <strong>elastic pool</strong> which is a collection of single databases that have a shared set of resources (CPU and memory).</p>

<h3 id="sql-managed-instance">SQL managed instance</h3>

<p>They are considered as Platform as a Service (PaaS) deployments. These options propose a fully managed engine that automates most of the database management tasks (upgrades, patches, backups and monitoring). Both have a set of common features but have distinct use cases. Notably, use the managed instances if you want to have access to some specific services / functions withing your DB (Machine learning services for example). Additionally, you can specify if you want a single instance or a pool of instances.</p>

<h3 id="sql-server-on-azure-virtual-machines">SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines</h3>

<p>It is a version of SQL server running in a Azure VM. It’s basically just SQL Server. This is an Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) with which you need to update and patch both OS and SQL server yourself. If your use case need such deployment, here a few things to consider that we gather in the methodology column in the table below:</p>

<h3 id="service-tiers">Service tiers</h3>

<h4 id="dtu-model">DTU model</h4>

<p>Known as the <strong>D</strong>atabase Transaction <strong>U</strong>nit purchasing model. This model is based on a bundled measure of compute, storage and I/O resources.  There are different service tiers available for the DTU model:</p>

<table>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that the backup retention time is different across the different tiers. However you can still enabled a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Long-Retention</code> period up to 10 years. In <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/in-memory-oltp-overview#benefits-of-in-memory-technology">memory OLTP</a> is enabled for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">premuim</code> tier. Premium are chosen for intensive I/O workload.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please keep in mind that <strong><em>DTU is not available for Azure SQL managed instances</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="virtual-core-model">Virtual core model</h3>

<p>This model allows a lot of flexibility given your use case. You have access to three groups of tiers:</p>

<h4 id="general-purpose-tier">General purpose tier</h4>

<p>It is a budget-friendly tier designed for most workloads with common performance and availability requirements. Here you can choose:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Provisioned compute:</strong> for regular usage pattern, fixed amount of resources over time and you are billed regardless of usage. You need to manage the sizing compute resources depending on your workload.</li>
  <li><strong>Serverless compute:</strong> for intermittent and unpredictable usage. It provides automatic scaling for compute resources and, you are billed only for the amount of compute used. This option also supports automatic pausing (in this setting you only pay for the storage).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-business-critical-tier">The business critical tier</h4>

<p>Business critical tier is designed for performance-sensitive workloads with strict availability requirements. This is particularly useful if you want low-latency, high resilience to failures with isolated replicas and use the In-Memory OLTP featue to improve performances.</p>

<h4 id="the-hypescale-tier">The hypescale tier</h4>

<p>It is designed for business workload that need highly scalable storage (+100TB) and read-scale requirements. Cost are between the general purpose and the business critical tiers. This tier is not available for <em>managed instances</em>. if you choose this one you cannot go back and change another tier. This is due to the underlying architecture needed to deploy a hyperscale Azure SQL database.</p>

<h4 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h4>

<p>Please see below a table that contains all strucutre the difference between the differnet tiers and display more specific details.</p>

<h3 id="create-deploy-and-verify-azure-sql">Create, deploy, and verify Azure SQL</h3>

<p>For Azure SQL managed instance, giving a server name is the same as in SQL Server. For Databases and elastic pools, an Azure SQL Database server is required. This is a logical server that acts as a central administrative point for single or pooled database. It contains logins, firewall rules, auditing rules, threat detections policies and failover groups. For Azure SQL Database server the <strong><em>name must be unique across all Azure</em></strong>.</p>

<p>With the vCore model we can choose one of the three service-tiers we described before. Here we chose the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">General Purpose</code> tier with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Provisioned</code> compute tier. <img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-27-07-Azure-SQL.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next note how the vCore model allows you to specify the amount of resources you want to allocate to your Database Server. The estimated cost is calculated in function of the selected resources.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that you may use some tools like the Data Migration Assistant SKU to estimate the number of vCores and the Data max size if you are not sure about what you should do, especially if you migrate your on-premises databases on Azure Cloud.</p>

<p>Next we can choose the connectivity options we want to access the Database. Your choice will depend on your specific requirements. Choices for Azure SQL Database or Managed Instance are different:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For SQL Databases the default is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">No access</code>. You can then choose a select or private endpoint. You can also add your client IP address if you want to connect from your current client.</li>
  <li>For Managed Instance you deploy inside an Azure virtual network with a dedicated subnet. As such you have a secure private IP. You can also enable public endpoint if you want to connect through the Internet without VPN. This access is disabled by default.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-27-09-Azure-SQL.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next you can decide which data source you want to use. You can start from scratch, use a sample of data or a Backup. Additionally you also need to specify the <strong>data collations</strong>. It is to tell the database engine how to treat certain characters (it affects the characteristic of several operations).</p>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-27-10-Azure-SQL.png" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>**Notes about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Database collation</code>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>In SQL server it is defined by OS locale.</li>
    <li>In Azure SQL managed instance you can set collation upon the creation of the instance (cannot be changed later for the instance but can be changed at the database or column level).</li>
    <li>With SQL Database you cannot change it at the server level but can alter it at the database level.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="working-with-elastic-pools">Working with Elastic pools</h2>

<p>Elastic pools are a cost effective solution you can choose when you need to manage several databases. This is particularly useful if you have unpredictable usage demands and don’t know the right setting to apply for your databases. Indeed you can group them into a pool.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>All the databases on a elastic pool are on a single server and share a set of resources</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly to single Azure SQL single Database you can choose between the DTU-based or the vCore-based pricing models. You can also specify the minimum and maximum number of resources shared between the databases that are added to the pool. As such, the database that are not used a lot will not consume much resources in the pool.</p>

<h2 id="geo-replication">Geo-replication</h2>

<p>This feature allows you to create a readable databases on a server in the same or different region. This particularly useful if you want to ensure business continuity so that an application recovers quickly from some unpredicted disaster and initiate a failover to the secondary database.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can have up to four secondaries databases in the same or different regions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note some specificities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>secondaries</em> are read-only copies of the database.</li>
  <li>Consequently they are useful to offload / redirect <strong>read-only workload</strong>  on the secondary database.</li>
</ul>

<p>To set geo-replication go to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ge-Replication</code> section and select a secondary target region. If the targeted region does not have one SQL server already deployed you will need to create one.</p>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-27-11-Azure-SQL.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<h4 id="network-security">Network security</h4>

<p>That is the first security layer you need to engineer and think about. Selective access to your database by services, applications and machines is critical to pave the way towards an secure database architecture. There are different way to tackle this.</p>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-27-12A-Azure-SQL.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>With the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Allow access to Azure services and resources</code> option set to “yes”, you permit to any resources from any region or subscription to access the SQL database. It is a very easy setup to get things up and running and get your SQL database connected to other Azure services as Azure VMs, Azure App Service. However, It is of good practice to not use this approach and prefer to set firewall rules instead of allowing all services to connect to your SQL database. With <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firewall rules</code> you add a unique firewall rule for each service or resource to connect. With thses rules you can permit to your on-premises environment to connect to your SQL database. You just need to also add the rules in your on-premise environment.</p>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-27-12B-Azure-SQL.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Setting the connectivity between resources with firewall rules is tedious. First you will have to enter manually all rules and all IP addresses. Second you might struggle if some IPs are dynamic. Instead you can use virtual network rules that control access for specific networks that contains  machines and / or services. You can allow all connections that come from one specific virtual net- work. This simplifies the challenge of configuring access for all static and dynamic IPs. In Virtual networks your machines expose a private IP address. Beside having private Ips you still connect through a public endpoint.</p>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-27-12C-Azure-SQL.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the last scenario for Azure SQL database, we get rid of the public endpoint and make it private: this is the concept of <strong>private link</strong>. You can connect to your Database using a private endpoint. It means that it has a private IP within a specific virtual network. We still have our architecture with Virtual Network, but here rules are unnecessary. Resources that need to connect to the Database must have access to the virtual network where the endpoint is located. As such any connection coming from the Internet will be denied.</p>

<h4 id="for-azure-sql-managed-instances">For Azure SQL managed instances</h4>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-27-12D-Azure-SQL.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You cannot use Azure Private link with managed instances. For an Azure SQL managed instance, you first need a specific subnet (here the MI-subnet). The subnet is a logical grouping in a virtual network. After the deployment the instances are configured similarly to a private endpoint in a database in Azure SQL Database. With standard networking practice you must enable access to the virtual network where the managed instances are 
located.</p>

<h2 id="backup-and-restore">Backup and restore</h2>

<p>Azure SQL manages backups and runs if the full recovery model is used. It can restore your database to any point in time. You can even restore a deleted database within the configured retention policy. Most interestingly your backups can be automatically encrypted if TDE is enabled on the logical server or instance. By default, a full database backup is taken once a week. Log backups occur every 5-10 minutes and differential backups every 12-24 hours. Backups files are stored in <strong>Azure storage</strong> in read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) by default (it is possible to set ZRS or LRS).</p>

<p>The retention period for your data varies between 1 and 35 days. If not enough you can choose long-term retention (LTR). This option automatically creates full backups stored in RA-GRS by default for up to 10 years. LTR is available for Azure SQL Database and in preview - <em>at time of writing</em> - for Azure SQL managed instanced.</p>

<h3 id="tuning-performance-in-azure-sql">Tuning performance in Azure SQL</h3>

<h4 id="automatic-tuning">Automatic tuning</h4>

<p>Automatic tuning ensures peak performance and stable workloads for Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance   through continuous performance tuning based on AI and machine learning. The automatic tuning options available for both Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance are the following:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Automatic tuning option</th>
      <th>Single database and pooled database support</th>
      <th>Instance database support</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left"><strong>CREATE INDEX</strong> - Identifies indexes that may improve performance of your workload, creates indexes, and automatically verifies that performance of queries has improved.</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left"><strong>DROP INDEX</strong> - Drops unused (over the last 90 days) and duplicate indexes. Unique indexes,  including indexes supporting primary key and unique constraints, are  never dropped. This option may be automatically disabled when queries  with index hints are present in the workload, or when the workload  performs partition switching. On Premium and Business Critical service  tiers, this option will never drop unused indexes, but will drop  duplicate indexes, if any.</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left"><strong>FORCE LAST GOOD PLAN</strong>  (automatic plan correction) - Identifies Azure SQL queries using an  execution plan that is slower than the previous good plan, and queries  using the last known good plan instead of the regressed plan.</td>
      <td> </td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>By default the following parameters will be enabled or disabled:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FORCE_LAST_GOOD_PLAN = enabled</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CREATE_INDEX = disabled</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DROP_INDEX = disabled</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="azure-synapse-analytics">Azure Synapse Analytics</h2>

<p>Azure Synapse Analytics (ASA) is an integrated analytics platform which combines data warehousing, big data analytics, data integration and visualization into a single environment. You can use ASA to answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>What happened:</em> This corresponds to <strong>descriptive analytics</strong> that involves the use of a Data warehouse using the dedicated SQL pool.</li>
  <li><em>Why did it happen:</em> This corresponds to <strong>diagnostic analysis</strong> where you may need to extends your scope of analysis by exploring and finding more data. This can still be done with the SQL pool.</li>
  <li><em>What will happen:</em> This corresponds to <strong>predictivie analysis</strong> based on previous trends or patterns, using the integrated Spark engine with the Azure Synapse Spark pools. These can be used with other services such as Azure Machine learning services or Azure Databricks.</li>
  <li><em>What should I do</em>: This corresponds to <strong>prescriptive analysis</strong> where you need to take actions based on real-time or near-real time analysis of data using predictive analytics. ASA provides this capability by harnessing both Apache Spark, Azure Synapse link and by integrating streaming technologies such as Azure Stream Analytics. Power BI is integrated to the service allowing to build interactive dashboard for real-time analysis.</li>
</ul>

<p>As such ASA is the right choice if you need to do <strong>modern data warehousing</strong>, <strong>advanced analytics</strong>, <strong>Data exploration and discovery</strong>, <strong>real time analytics</strong> and <strong>data integration</strong> to ingest, prepare, model and serve the data to be used by downstream systems (outside or inside AZA).</p>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-28-01-azure-synapse-analytics.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="architecture-of-azure-synapse-analytics">Architecture of Azure Synapse Analytics</h2>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-28-02-azure-synapse-analytics.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We could divide the architecture in 4 main groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compute options:</strong> Provisioned SQL Pools (old Azure DW), on-demand SQL Pools (Serverless, can directly query Azure Data Lake, useful for ad-hoc analysis). We also got Provisioned Spark Pools (C#, Scala, Python, R, Java). be careful this is not Databricks.</li>
  <li><strong>Orchestration options:</strong> Azure Data Factory with ADF Mapping Data Flows</li>
  <li><strong>Storage options:</strong> Data Lake Store Gen2, a shared Metadata store that permits to share databases and tables between the different engines. You can for example access Spark tables with the SQL engines to create their own objects.</li>
  <li><strong>Workspace options:</strong> Azure Synapse Studio (a complete development environment to use), Monitoring and Management.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="synapse-sql-pools">Synapse SQL Pools</h3>

<p>You have two approaches for the Synapses SQL pool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The dedicated model is referred to as dedicated SQL Pools. It refers to the <strong>data warehousing</strong> features that are generally available in Azure Synapse Analytics. Dedicated SQL pools represent a collection of resources (nodes) that are being provisioned when using Synapse SQL. Use the dedicated setup when you need (i) predictable performance and cost, (ii) create dedicated SQL pools to allocate processing power for <strong>data permanently stored in SQL tables</strong>.</li>
  <li>The serverless model is ideal for <strong>unplanned or ad hoc workloads</strong> as performing data exploration or preparing data for data virtualization.</li>
</ul>

<p>With Synapse SQL pool you can load data in different ways. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>directly with T-SQL and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">COPY</code> statement</p>

    <div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">COPY</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">dbo</span><span class="p">].[</span><span class="n">YOUR_TABLE</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="s1">'https://URI_TO_YOUR_BLOB'</span>
<span class="k">WITH</span> <span class="p">(</span>
	<span class="n">FIELDTERMINATOR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">','</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="n">ROWTERMINATOR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'0x0A'</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>with the pipeline and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Copy Data</code> activity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>with <strong>T-SQL and PolyBase</strong> to define external tables. Polybase is tool that virtualizes the external data through the SQL pool, so that it can be queried in place like any other table. <strong>In Azure Synapse you can use Polybase only with data stored in Azure Data Lake</strong>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Loading data with polybase implies to follow some steps:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>First set the external data source typically Azure Data Lake.</li>
        <li>Second create an database scoped credential to import data.</li>
        <li>Third Create the file format.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When loading data consider running a single load job. If not possible run a minimal of loads concurrently. For large loading jobs, consider scaling up the SQL pool.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="architecture-of-synapse-sql">Architecture of Synapse SQL</h4>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-28-04-azure-synapse-analytics.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Synapse SQL is a distributed computational architecture to process data across several nodes.</li>
  <li>Compute is uncoupled from storage allowing to scale compute resource independently of the data / storage. For dedicated pool scaling is based on the data warehouse unit (DWU) that is a combination of CPU, memory, and IO whereas scaling is done automatically for serverless SQL pool.</li>
  <li>Query are sent to the control node. The control node will use the <strong>massively parallel processing engine</strong> (<strong>MPP engine, 60 nodes</strong>) to distribute the query across several worker nodes. The MPP engine optimizes the queries for parallel processing.</li>
  <li>The compute nodes store all of the user data in Azure Storage (Data Lake). More interestingly note the presence of a <strong>Data Movement Service</strong> implemented to optimize the movement of Data across nodes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="usage-cost">Usage cost</h4>

<p>To monitor usage cost, Azure uses a metric called <strong>Data Warehousing Unit</strong> (DWU) that is a bundle of resources (CPU, memory and IOs). You need to specify the number of DWU you need for the pool. If you want higher performance for your workload at any point in time, just increase the numbers of DWU.</p>

<h4 id="create-an-azure-synapse-analytics-instance">Create an Azure Synapse Analytics instance</h4>

<p>The procedure is very similar to create an Azure SQL instance. You need to specify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SQL pool name</code> and choose a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Server</code>. If you already have deployed SQL server you can use them. Otherwise create one.</p>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-28-05-azure-synapse-analytics.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="partitioning">Partitioning</h2>

<h3 id="designing-partitions-in-sql-databases">Designing Partitions in SQL databases</h3>

<p>There are three types of partitioning strategies:</p>

<h4 id="horizontal-partitioning">Horizontal partitioning</h4>

<p>In horizontal partitioning, also called sharding, we choose a column as the partition key. Based on it, we split the data on several partition on distinct node. Each node will have less load.</p>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-28-07-azure-synapse-analytics.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here we split the original table in two partitions based on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Key</code> column and alphabetical order. If we need to add a entry with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Key</code> values starting by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F</code> it will go to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A-G</code> partition (or “shard”). Be careful though, choosing the correct partition key is critical. Indeed the key needs to be randomly distributed to  avoid having unbalanced partitions and distribute loads evenly.</p>

<h5 id="choosing-the-right-partition-key">Choosing the right partition key</h5>

<p>Let’s see through a simple example what could be wrong when choosing some partition keys. Consider the following table:</p>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-28-08-azure-synapse-analytics.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let’s consider the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Has Stock</code> column as the partition key. What would happen here?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The column has low cardinality. Values will be distributed between only two shards that will get bigger and bigger which is not optimal in an horizontal scaling scenario.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s consider the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Last Ordered</code> column as the partition key. What would happen here?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Date are usually a good partition key. Date has high-cardinality and will distribute values across several shards. However,  we are talking about the <strong>last order date</strong>. This means that the value for this column will change over-time and will promote some re-shuffling between partitions in case of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UPDATE</code> operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s consider the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Price</code> column as the partition key. What would happen here?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Price should follow a normal distribution (with a bell shape). The distribution over the different shards is not even and would induce some hot spots in your database.</li>
</ul>

<p>From these we can extract some simple principle when  choosing your partition key:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Should have  high cardinality</li>
  <li>Should be Static (won’t need to be re-suffled to another partition)</li>
  <li>Should distribute frequency evenly</li>
  <li>Should distribute loads evenly</li>
  <li>Should supports ordering functions.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="vertical-partitioning">Vertical partitioning</h4>

<p>Vertical partitioning helps to reduce I/O and performance cost associated with fetching items that are frequently accessed.</p>

<p><img src="/home/fbraza/Documents/BLOG/BrazLog/images/2021-07-28-06-azure-synapse-analytics.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In our example above, the tables are split so that one (on the left here) holds the records that are frequently accessed and the other one holds records that are infrequently accessed. By splitting vertically you can then decide to treat each table independently from a security point of view.</p>

<h4 id="functional-partitioning">Functional partitioning</h4>

<p>It refers to separate data from different domains into different physical nodes to ensure better isolation and performance. You could for example split records into an archive table.</p>

<h3 id="partition-and-tables-in-azure-synapse-analytics">Partition and Tables in Azure Synapse Analytics</h3>

<h4 id="the-law-of-60">The law of 60</h4>

<p>For optimal compression and performance of clustered columnstores, a minimum of 1 million rows per distribution and partition is needed. Before partitions are created Synapse pools already divides each tables into 60 databases. If a table contained 36 monthly partitions and given that a dedicated SQL pool has 60 nodes per partitions, then the table should contain 60 millions of rows by month which is equivalent of 2.16 billions of rows (36 * 60 * 1 000 000).</p>

<h4 id="tables-types">Tables types</h4>

<p>The concepts described now are some definitions of common Data Warehousing approaches and do not strictly apply to Azure Synapse. Typically in a data warehouse you have three types of tables:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Integration tables</strong> that are used to integrate the raw data into the staging area.</li>
  <li><strong>Fact tables</strong> that contain quantitative data generally loaded from transactional table (e.g, sales).</li>
  <li><strong>Dimension tables</strong> that contain attribute data that does not change frequently and use to make joins with the fact tables.</li>
</ul>

<p>When using Azure Synapse Analytics or another data warehousing tool like Hive, you have different choice for the persistence of your tables. In Azure Synapse you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Regular tables</strong> that are stored in Azure storage as part of the SQL.</li>
  <li><strong>Temporary tables</strong> that last as long as the session and use local storage for performance.</li>
  <li><strong>External tables</strong> that are useful to first load data. In Azure, external tables point to and reference data in an Azure Storage blob or Azure Data Lake.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="distributions">Distributions</h4>

<p>When created tables you need to choose the types of tables you want. be careful choosing the type will have impact on performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hash-distributed tables</strong> - The table rows are distributed across the Compute nodes by using a deterministic hash function to assign each row to one <strong>distribution</strong>. A distribution is the basic unit of storage and processing for parallel queries. This particularly good for querying large tables (<em>more than 2 GB</em>) or if you have frequent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE</code> operations.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The choice of the distributed columns is important:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NULLABLE</code> columns are bad candidates as they are going to generate the same hashed result. As such, rows will end up on the same skewed distribution. Columns with date are also bad candidates. Fact tables with columns containing default values or date values are not good candidates for hashed distribution.</li>
        <li>Large fact tables or historical transaction tables are usually stored as hash-distributed tables. These tables usually have a surrogate key that is monotonically increasing and are used in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JOIN</code> with other facts or dimension tables. These surrogate keys are good candidates for distributing the data as they are unique.</li>
        <li>Choose a column that will be used in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JOIN</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GROUP BY</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DISTINCT</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OVER</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HAVING</code> clauses. When two large fact tables have frequent joins, query performance improves when you distribute both tables on one of the join columns. When a table is not used in joins, consider distributing the table on a column that is frequently in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GROUP BY</code> clause.</li>
        <li>Do not distribute column that will be used for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code> clauses, this narrows the query to not run on all distributions.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Replicated tables</strong> - A table that is replicated caches a full copy of the table on each compute node. Consequently, replicating a table removes the need to transfer data among compute nodes before a join or aggregation. Replicated tables are best utilized with small tables. Extra storage is required and there is additional overhead that is incurred when writing data, which make large tables impractical.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Round-robin tables</strong> - A round-robin distributed table distributes data evenly across the table but without any further optimization. A distribution is first chosen at random and then buffers of rows are assigned to distributions sequentially. <strong>It is recommended to load data into a round-robin table</strong> for staging. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JOIN</code> operations on round-robin tables require reshuffling data, which takes additional time.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Dimension tables or other lookup tables are stored as round-robin tables. These tables connects to more than one fact tables and optimizing for one <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JOIN</code> may not be the best idea. Usually, dimension tables are smaller which may leave some distributions empty when hash distributed whereas round-robin by definition, guarantees a uniform data distribution.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="spark-pools">Spark pools</h3>

<p>Spark pool clusters are groups of computers that are treated as a single computer to handle the execution of commands issued from notebooks. Clusters allow processing of data to be parallelized across many computers to improve scale and performance. It consists of a <strong>Spark Driver</strong> and <strong>Worker nodes</strong>. The Driver node sends work to the Worker nodes and instructs them to pull data from a specified data source. Moreover, you can configure the number of nodes that are required to perform the task.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some usage details:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It takes around two minutes for fewer than 60 nodes and around 5 minutes for more to spin-up. The instance shut down automatically and by-default 5 minutes after the last job has been executed unless it is kept alive by a notebook connection.</li>
    <li>You can create Spark pool with the portal, Power Shell or C# SDK</li>
    <li>You can enable auto-scale to let pools automatically scale-up or down based on the workloads. Spark pools can be shut down with no loss of data since data is stored elsewhere on a Data Lake.</li>
    <li>Spark pools can use Data Lake Store Gen2 and Blob storage.</li>
    <li>Come with Anaconda librairies pre-installed.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>If you need to process big data workloads that cannot be handle by Azure Synapse SQL use the Spark pools. If you have some Spark code already implemented use it! Do not re-implement it with Spark pools.</p>

<h2 id="auditing">Auditing</h2>

<p>You can enable auditing for an Azure SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics. It is used to track database events and write them to an audit log. These logs are stored in Azure storage account, Log Analytics workspace or Azure Event Hubs. Auditing helps to get regulatory compliance and gain insights about any abnormalities when it comes to databases activities.</p>

<p>Auditing can be enabled at the data warehouse or server level. If done at the server level, it will be applied to all of the data warehouses that reside on the server.</p>

<h3 id="log-analytics-workspace">Log Analytics workspace</h3>

<ul>
  <li>It gives you a central place when you can redirect logging data from various resources.</li>
  <li>Use the Kusto query language to interrogate the logging data.</li>
  <li>You can create alerts based on the data present in the workspace</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-discovery-and-classification">Data Discovery and Classification</h2>

<ul>
  <li>This feature enables the user to discover, classify, label and report the sensitive data in your databases.</li>
  <li>It can the database and identify columns that contains sensitive data and suggest some recommendations that you can follow or not.</li>
  <li>You can define sensitivity labels to the column to define the sensitivity level of the data stored in this particular column.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="security-1">Security</h2>

<h3 id="dynamic-data-masking">Dynamic Data masking</h3>

<p>Dynamic data masking is a technique used to limit the exposure of sensitive data to non-privileged users. You can mask your data so that non-privileged users can’t see it but are still able to use query that include the data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Administrator are always excluded from the masking rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example if you have data with names and e-mail addresses you can mask columns with the following T-SQL commands:</p>

<pre><code class="language-SQL">ALTER TABLE Data.Membership ALTER COLUMN FirstName
ADD MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'partial(1, "xxxxx", 1)')

ALTER TABLE Data.Membership ALTER COLUMN Email

</code></pre>

<p>There are different policies in place to mask the data:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Default</code> - This is a full masking of the data. For numeric data types the value will be set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> and for strings,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XXX</code> characters are used to mask fields.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Credit card</code> - Here only the last four digits of the credit card are shown.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Email</code> - This exposes the first letter and replaces the domain with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XXX</code>.com.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Random number</code> - This function generate a random number based on the selected boundaries and the actual data type.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Custom text</code> - Here you can define the exposed prefix, the padding string and the exposed suffix,</li>
</ul>

<p>Once data masking is et up, you can identify when a user tries to access data from any of the masked column using <strong>Auditing</strong>. Indeed Azure SQL auditing tracks all databases events and writes them to an audit log in your Azure Storage account in <strong>Append Blobs</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="data-encryption">Data encryption</h3>

<h4 id="transparent-data-encryption-tde">Transparent data encryption (TDE)</h4>

<p>It is used to <strong>protect data at rest</strong> for an Azure SQL database. When using TDE, your data, but also backups and transaction logs are encrypted at rest. With the default settings TDE uses a <strong>database encryption key</strong> that is protected by a <strong>built-in server certificate</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>You have one distinct built-in certificate by database server</li>
    <li>You can also use customer-managed keys for the encryption (Bring Your Own Key service - BYOK). Here the encryptions keys can be managed by by the Azure Key vault service. With this scenario you are responsible for the control of the key life-cycle, key usage permissions and auditing operations on keys.</li>
    <li>
      <p>To enable TDE for SQL server here the steps yo must follow:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create a master key.</li>
        <li>Create or obtain a certificate protected by the master key.</li>
        <li>Create a database encryption key and protect it by using the certificate.</li>
        <li>Set the database to use encryption.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="always-encrypted">Always encrypted</h4>

<p>This is used to protect sensitive data at rest on the server, in-transit between client and server and when the data is in use. As expected, keys are used to encrypt the data and, only client applications or applications servers with access to the keys, will be able to see the data in plain text. You have two types of keys used for the encryption process:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Column encryption keys</strong> - It is used to encrypt the data.</li>
  <li><strong>Column master keys</strong> - It is used to encrypt the column encryption keys. These need to be stored in a trusted location like the Windows Certificate store or the Azure Key Vault service.</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Always encrypted</code> feature support two types of encryption:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Deterministic encryption</strong> - This will ALWAYS generate the same encrypted value for any text value.  You can still perform point lookups, equality joins, grouping and indexing on deterministically encrypted columns.</li>
  <li><strong>Randomized encryption</strong> - This is more secure because the encrypted value is less predictable, however, you cannot perform, searching, indexing, grouping or joins if columns are encrypted with this method.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be able to use this feature you need to</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an instance of the Azure key Vault service.</li>
  <li>Encrypt columns on SQL server / instance where you can also choose the type of encryption and the key store (Azure key vault)
    <ul>
      <li>This will create the new master key, the new encryption key and encrypt your column.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="column-level-security">Column-level Security</h4>

<p>This approach permits to control access to columns in a Table. It is based on users context. You can grant grant access via the SQL user or Azure AD. The way you implement column-level security is by granting access to only the column you want a user to view. The ones that you do not include in the granting process will be unavailable. To do this follow the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Create a test user first and grant him access to some columns:</p>

    <div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">USER</span> <span class="n">TestUser</span> <span class="k">WITHOUT</span> <span class="n">LOGIN</span><span class="p">;</span>
  
<span class="k">GRANT</span> <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="k">ON</span> <span class="n">myTable</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ID</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">FirstName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">LastName</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">TO</span> <span class="n">TestUser</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switch to the user context and try selecting all the columns:</p>

    <div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">-- Change context to testUser</span>
<span class="k">EXECUTE</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="k">USER</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'TestUser'</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">-- This will give an error message</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">myTable</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">-- Specify the columns</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">ID</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">FirstName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">LastName</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">myTable</span>
  
<span class="n">REVERT</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Always good to make test on a test user before implementing it for real users.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="row-level-security">Row-level Security</h4>

<p>You can encrypt data at row-level preventing people to be able to access records with specific values. This is not Permission-based but <strong>Predicate-based</strong>. For that you need to define your security policy by creating a security predicate known as ab <em>Inline Table-Valued Function</em> (iTVF). There many possible predicate but a common one is the <strong>Filter-Predicate</strong>. it will silently filter the rows the user does not have access to for read operations. The different steps to implement Row-level encryption are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a Table (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CREATE TABLE ...</code>).</li>
  <li>Insert rows (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSERT INTO ...</code>).</li>
  <li>Create users (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CREATE USER ...</code>).</li>
  <li>Create schema (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CREATE SCHEMA</code>).</li>
  <li>Create  security predicate (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CREATE FUNCTION</code>).</li>
  <li>Create security policy and bind it to the security predicate (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CREATE SECURITY POLICY</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="manage-security">Manage security</h2>

<p>Once your instance is secured (network, authentication and data), we need to manage security on an ongoing basis. This includes auditing, monitoring, data classification and in the case of Azure SQL, Azure Defender. Here let’s give a few words about Azure Defender that is a unified package for advance SQL security capabilities that enables:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Vulnerability Assessment:</strong> a scanning service that provides visibility into security state and suggest approaches to address any potential concerns. You can activate the periodic recurring scans for database checking every seven days. Reports can be sent to an administrator and store in a storage account (Blob store).</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced Threat Protection:</strong> uses advanced monitoring and artificial intelligence to detect whether any of the following threats have occurred: SQL injection, SQL injection vulnerability, Data exfiltration, unsafe action, brute force attempt, anomalous client login.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example if you need to prevent data leakage here what you should do:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Enable Advanced threat detection</li>
    <li>Configure the service to send alerts for threat detections of type “Data Exfiltration”</li>
    <li>Configure the service to send email alerts to the IT</li>
  </ul>
